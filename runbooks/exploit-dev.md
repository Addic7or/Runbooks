## Buffer Overflow

**Check for ASLR**

```cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize__va_space```

| Value | Type |
|-------|-------------|
| 0  | No randomization. Everything is static |
| 1  | Conservative randomization. Shared libraries, stack, mmap(), VDSO and heap are randomized |
| 2  | Full randomization. In addition to elements listed in the previous point, memory managed through brk() is also randomized |


```echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space```

Disable ASLR(Will not survive reboot)

```echo 2 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space```

Enable ASLR

```kernel.randomize_va_space = 0```

Set this inside(/etc/sysctl.d/01-disable-aslr.conf) to make persistant

```setarch `uname -m` -R /bin/bash```

Open bash shell with ASLR disabled

**Testing**

```./filename $(python -c 'print "A"*100')```

Simple small buffer into binary

```(gdb)run $(python -c 'print "A"*100')```

Simple small buffer into binary with GDB
